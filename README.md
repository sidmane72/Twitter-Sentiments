# Twitter-Sentiments
Developed a Sentiment Analysis model using Tensorflow that assigns a sentiment looking at the review/chat of the product.
Used pre-built embeddings for your data dictionary

Trained the model using Transformer/Attention based architecture

Reached an overall “precision” score of 85%

Used TF serving to deploy the model as an API (on local)

Built a TF serving client to interact with the API. This client should also be able to continuously accept data entered by the user and provide the sentiment for the review/chat entered by the end-user.
In Presentation.pdf, Every step is explained in Detail.
